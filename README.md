### Hi there, I am Zeynep 🧑🏻‍🔬

🏞️ I am an aquatic ecologist from Turkey, working in Spain. In my research, I focus on changes in freshwater food webs across environmental, anthropogenic and biogeographical gradients, using approaches ranging from mesocosm experiments to quantitative analyses.

I also like science communication🔬, bird watching🦉 and singing 🎶.
